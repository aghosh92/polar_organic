This repository is associated with the study of polar organic compounds, as detailed in the manuscript, 
namely "Identification of novel organic polar materials: A machine learning study with importance sampling".

[Publication preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13206)

Datasets utilized to construct all models as mentioned in the manuscript can be found under the folder 'Datasets' in this repository.

Notebook shows an example of how Random Forest Regression model can be trained and tested for the datasets. 
Here, the sampled dataset (data_sampled_combined.csv 
refereed to as Dataset II in manuscript) is utilized for training only. 
The testing is performed on the original dataset
(data_original_compounds.csv refereed to as Dataset II in manuscript). [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aghosh92/polar_organic/blob/main/Notebook_I.ipynb)

Notebook shows an example implementation of importance-sampling approach which is used for generating sampled dataset for this work.
